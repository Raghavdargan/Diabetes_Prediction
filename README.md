# Diabetes_Prediction

## Project Description
This project is a web-based application designed to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. The application is built using Python and Django, and it leverages a machine learning model trained on the popular Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The goal of the project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for users to assess their diabetes risk by entering specific health-related metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of some key health parameters:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the user has been pregnant.
- **Glucose Level**: Blood glucose concentration.
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the user in years.

## Model Description
The following machine learning models were implemented in this project:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Gradient Booster Classifier**
- **SVC**
- **KNN**
- **CatBoost Classifier**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Extra Tree Classifier**

- ## Conclusion
A web application has been developed as part of this project, where various machine learning models were implemented to predict diabetes risk. Among these models, the Extra Tree Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving a score of 0.83. This result highlights the model's effectiveness in making reliable predictions based on the given dataset.
